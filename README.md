Data Analysis and Visualization with Adult Census Dataset
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates data loading, cleaning, analysis, and visualization using the Adult Census Income dataset
. The dataset is used to explore demographic and income-related features such as age, education, work hours, and income categories.

The script performs the following tasks:

Load and explore the dataset using pandas.

Clean the dataset by handling missing values.

Basic statistical analysis (descriptive statistics, grouping, aggregation).

Data visualizations with matplotlib and seaborn:

Line chart (Age trend)

Bar chart (Average working hours per education level)

Histogram (Age distribution)

Scatter plot (Age vs. Hours-per-week, colored by sex)

⚙️ Requirements

Install dependencies before running the script:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy

📂 Dataset

The script expects the dataset file adult.csv located at:

D:\Desktop\wk-7-python\adult.csv


If the file is not found, you will see an error message. You can download the dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository
 and update the file path in the script accordingly.

🚀 Usage

Run the script with:

python analysis.py


(where analysis.py is the filename of your script).

What happens:

The dataset is loaded and inspected (.head(), .info(), missing values check).

Missing values are removed.

Descriptive statistics are printed.

Grouped insights are shown (e.g., average age by education level).

Multiple visualizations are displayed interactively.

📊 Example Outputs

Line Chart: Age trend for the first 100 records.

Bar Chart: Average weekly working hours per education level.

Histogram: Age distribution with kernel density estimate (KDE).

Scatter Plot: Relationship between age and weekly working hours, colored by sex.

🔧 Customization

Update the file path (D:\Desktop\wk-7-python\adult.csv) to match your dataset location.

Modify column names or analysis logic to adapt to different datasets.

Extend the script with additional plots or statistical methods.

📜 License

This project is for educational purposes. The Adult dataset is publicly available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

👉 Do you want me to also include sample screenshots of the plots in the README so it looks more professional, or keep it text-only?
